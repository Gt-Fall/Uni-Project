# Uni-Project
Files and Report from University Project. Web Application and Report showing full development. 

My university project took a customer request for an online catalogue of items they made and sold, an email ordering/enquiry system and an online admin management system. This was a 6 month project done part time as part of my Open University Degree. 

This repository has the code files without all the node modules and dependences. This application was designed and developed but never put into production and the customer stopped making their items before the project was finished, therefore the application is online. 

The project was made up of two main parts, the coding skills and the project development skills.

Project Development
-	Took customers needs and made these into project Requirements. 
-	Refined these requirements using a Volere Template
-	Split project into increments and used a Gantt Chart to schedule these increments. 
-	Designed the project with Use Cases and Class Diagrams
-	Researched solutions and used documentation to overcome issues.
-	Fully tested the project. 

Coding 
-	I learned to use React and used features such as hooks to develop an interactive web application.
-	I learned how to effectively use API and how to call data from storage (Both local and Remote on a database). 
-	I developed my JavaScript, CSS and HTML skills. I used call back functions more than I had before. 
-	I used an external Database to store data.

The finished Web Application allowed the user to:
-	Browses all items for sale and see their live stock level. 
-	Make an order through email for several items. 
-	The owner could manage all orders made on the site and could add orders to the portal made outside the web app. 
-	The owner could add/edit/delete all stock items on the web app. 

I would like to have had more time to develop a backend using Node.js but at the time I did not have the knowledge I have now (See Node.js Project repo) and learning React took a lot of time. 

This project scored 85/100, resulting in a distinction grade for the project module.
